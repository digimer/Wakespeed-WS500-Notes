## CAN Configuration Table
# Battery Instance Override = [0..100 - whole number] Sets the battery type. 0 = Use DIP switches 1 and 2. 
#                             See - https://www.wakespeed.com/wp-content/uploads/WS500-Quick-Start-Guide-09-30-2022-V3.pdf
#                             NOTE: Does not specify what integers relate to what config! So use DIP 
#                             switches 1 = Off, 2 = Off (house).
# Device Instance           = [1..13 - whole number] This is used to distinguish multiple WS500s on the same
#                             network. Default is 1, and if there is a conflict, the WS500s will change this
#                             on their own, albeit unpredictably. Arabella won't have a second WS500, so this
#                             can be left at '1'.
# Device Priority           = [1..250 - whole number] This indicates the priority of the alternator on the 
#                             OSEnergy bus. If a higher priority (higher value) device is able to meet the
#                             load and charge requirements, this alternator will stop outputting power. If 
#                             equal to another device, charge output will balance between the devices. This
#                             also indicates which device will be the Remote Master Battery (see below).
# AllowRMB?                 = [0..2 - whole number] This controls if the regulator can become the RBM, a mode
#                             where the alternator can react to data on the CANbus from certain BMSes. When 
#                             charging occurs depending on individual cell voltages, if available on the 
#                             CANbus. Note: I can not find good documentation on this feature. 0 = disabled,
#                             1 = Allow to take the role, if needed. 2 = Allow to take the role as a 
#                             "virtual" device. 
# ShuntAtBat?               = [0,1] This tells the regulator if the information from the shunt is relative to
#                             the battery (1) or alternator (0). Used during RMB operation.
# Enable-OSE?               = [0,1] This enables (1) or disables (0) OSEnergy communication on the CANbus. 
#                             For more on OSEnergy, see: - https://github.com/OSEnergy/Specification
# Enable-NMEA2000?          = [0,1] This enables (1) or disables (0) NMEA2000 messaging. 
# Enable_ALT_CAN?           = [0..255 - whole number] This allows for alternative CAN communication to be 
#                             enabled. 0 = disables additional CAN communication. The rest of the values are
#                             explained on page 65. 
# Engine ID                 = [0..250 - whole number] This allows for the alternator to be associated with a
#                             matching engine J1939 engine RPM signal. This overrides the RPM read from the
#                             stator.  
# BitRate                   = [0..4 - whole number] This allows changing the BAUD rate used on the CANbus.
#                             0 = 250 kbps (default), 1 = 100 kbps, 2 = 125 kbps, 3 = 250 kbps (??) and 
#                             4 = 500 kbps.
# DC_Disconnected_VBat      = [0.0..20.0 - float] If set to 0.0, this is disabled. At any other value, if a 
#                             "DC-Disconnect" message is received on the CANbus, the regulator will switch to
#                             a constant voltage output, with the voltage matching this setting. If set to 0.0
#                             then the alternator will disable current output.
# Aggregate_BMS             = [0..10 - whole number] For installations with multiple (CANbus) BMSes, this 
#                             allows for grouping the BMSes onto common buses, allowing the regulator to 
#                             aggregate current, charge and other data. See page 66 for more info.

## Changes Alternator (and System) parameters
# BTS2ATS?         = Battery Temperature Sensor to second Alternator Temperature Sensor control. 0 == Use as 
#                    Battery Temp Sensor, 1 == Use as second Alternator Temp Sensor. If 0, battery temp must 
#                    be on CANbus.
# Alt Target Temp  = [15..150 - whole number] Temperature above which the regulator will reduce field current.
#                    If this temp is exceeded by 10%, the regulator will fault and cut all output current.
# Alt Derate (x)   = [0.0..1.0 - Floating point] Three versions; 'norm', 'small' and 'half'. This sets the 
#                    amount, as a percentage between 10~100%, to derate the alternator's output when one of
#                    these three modes is used. 100% == no defating, 10% == 10% of rated output, 0.0 == Shut
#                    down output and enter a ready-idle state. See pages 36 and 49.
# PBF              = [-1..10 - Integer] "Pull Back Factor" for reducing field drive at low RPM. If the stator
#                    wire allows reading the RPM, this will allow the alternator field drive to reduce output.
#                    0 = Disabled. -1 == If the regulator could read the RPM, but then loses the signal, cut 
#                    the output by 70%. Recommended to use '1' for most cases, with higher numbers for higher
#                    output at lower RPMs. See page 50. 
#                    **NOTE**: Changed from 0 to 1  - Verify tach set via $SCT
# Alt Amp Cap      = [-1..500 - whole number] Alternator Amperage Capacity. This sets a hard limit on the 
#                    current output from the alternator. This is used for the derating calculations. When set
#                    to -1, the alternator will be driven at full power during bulk to detect the maximum
#                    output. 0 = disable, 1..500 = Capacity in Amps.
# System Watt Cap  = [-1..20000 - whole number ] This is used to place a limit on the work the engine is 
#                    asked to do in order to protect the engine/belts from overloading. It multiplies the 
#                    alternator's output voltage and amperage to calculate wattage. If set to -1, it will 
#                    drive the alternator at max power during initial bulk charging to calculate this 
#                    automatically. 0 = Disabled, 1..20000 = max watts after which the alternator is 
#                    deregulated.
# Amp Shunt Ratio  = [500..20000 - whole number] The ratio of your amp measurement shunt in terms of 
#                    Amps / mVolts. e.g., if you have a 250A / 75mV shunt, you would enter 3333 (250/0.075). 
#                    And you may adjust the number to allow for fine tuning of the Amp Shunt. e.g., if your 
#                    shunt has a 3% error, you could enter 3433.
#                    Caution: Shunt Voltage is limited to +/-80mV. Do NOT exceed this value!
# Shunt Reversed?  = This allows for correcting for shunts installed backwards. Set to 0 to disable, or 
#                    1 to indicate that the shunt is in backwards.
# Idle RPMs        = [0..2500 - whole number] Used with PBF to calculate when to pull back based on the read
#                    RPM. Setting to 0 sets the auto-detect mode, which is recommended.
# Warmup Delay     = [-600..-15, 15..600 - whole number] This sets the number of second to wait before adding
#                    load to the engine and beginning to output power. When a negative number is used, the 
#                    fast-ramp feature is disable, and ramping of output is slower. 
# Required Sensors = [0..255 - whole number] This number indicates the collective sum of assinged values
#                    indicating which collectin of sensors are required. If any are missing, the alternator
#                    will reduce output to protect the system. See page 53 for the sensor list.
# Ignore Sensors   = [0..255 - whole number] This is the invert of Required Sensors, and tells the WS500 to
#                    ignore these missing sensors entirely. See page 54.
# BMS Amp Cap      = [0..2500 - whole number] This sets the maximum input current the batteries can take 
#                    while charging. In Arabella, this is 40A/70A (recommended/max) per battery. Being 4P, 
#                    this is 160A/280A in practice. The alternator in the boat is 120A, so this can be left
#                    as 0 = Disabled.

## Changes Tachometer Settings.
# Alt Poles              = [2..25] Number of poles in the Alternator.
# Eng/Alt drive ratio    = [0.5..50 - float] This is the ratio between the engine drive pully and the 
#                          alternator's pully. Example, if the engine's pulley is 7" and the alternator is
#                          2.6", this is 7.0/2.3 = 2.6923
# Tach Min Field         = [-1..30 - whole number] NOTE: This is a value than can cause damage to your 
#                          batteries! Read page 56 to understand how to set this for your installation.
#                          0 = Disabled.
# ForceTM                = [0,1] This disables (0 - default) or enables (1) "Tach Mode". Read "Tach Min
#                          Field" docs to understand how this effects charging. 
# Trigger Half-Power RPM = [0..10000 - whole number] This sets the RPM under which half-power mode is 
#                          triggered. This is meant to be used with RPM from the J1939 bus. 0 = Disabled.

# Reg Name     = [String up to 18 char, no spaces, no comma, no @] - This is the name used for the CAN ID.
# Reg Password = [String up to 18 char, no spaces, no comma, no @] - This is the password for accessing the
#                regulator. Note that if this starts with a '.', the password is hidden (and the '.' is

## Over-ride Features
# CP_Index    = [0..8 - whole number] Which charge profile should be used? 0 = Use dip switches. 
#               NOTE: I can't find a specific mapping of integer to mode table. It might be _assumed_ that;
#               1 = AGM #1           (DIP 3 = off, 4 = off, 5 = off)

#               8 = Custom #2 LFP    (DIP 3 = on,  4 = on,  5 = on)
# BC_Index    = [0.0..+/-10.0 - float] Battery Capacity multiplier used against the "normalized" 500Ah 
#               battery. 0.00 = Use DIP switches #6 and #7. Arabella has 4x 206Ah SOK batteries, for a bank
#               capacity of 824Ah, or 1.648. If this is set to -1.6, then receiving the 
#               capacity over the CAN bus won't override this setting. 
# SV_Override = [0.0..4.5 - float] Allows for forcing a system voltage. By default (0.0) this is 
#               automatically determined. If your system voltage isn't a simple multiple of 12, this can
#               be used to set a multiplier for force a voltage. See page 58 for the table of multipliers.
# Lockout     = [0,1] This locks the configuration to prevent any further changes. This must be used 
#               carefully, as a lock-out can only be removed with a master reset, if you have the password, 
#               or if the unit is sent back to the factory for reset! Leave as '0' for normal use, set to '1'
#               to enable the lock-out.
# Feature-IN  = [0..2] Modifies the behaviour of the "Feature In" port. '0' is default, see page 59 for a
#               how '1' and '2' change the behaviour.
# Feature-OUT = [0..2] Modifies the behaviour of the "Feature Out" port. '0' is default, see page 60 for a
#               how '1' and '2' change the behaviour.

## Change ACCEPT parameters in CPE
# n              = [7,8] Charge Profile Table Entry that will be modified
# VBat Set Point = [0.0..16.5 - float] Voltage used to set the Accept (absorption) voltage. When the voltage
#                  reaches this point, the regulator will switch from bulk mode to accept (absorption) mode.
#                  Accept (Absorption) phase is where the battery is allowed to slowly aborbe charge with a
#                  constant voltage, where bulk is constant current.
#                  **NOTE**: Changed from 13.8 (3.45v/cell) to 14.0 (3.5v/cell). 
# Exit Duration  = [0..600 - whole number] This is the number of minutes after entering accept (absorbtion) 
#                  when charging stops. When set to '0', current based exiting is used (see below).
#                  **NOTE**: Changed from 30 (minutes) to 0 (disabled).
# Exit Amps      = [-1..200 - whole number] This sets the amperage where, during accept (absorbtion) mode, if
#                  the draw from the alternator drops below this current, the regulat will switch to float
#                  mode and stop charging. The recommended charge rate for the SOK 206Ah batteries is 40A, so
#                  10% of that is 4A, time 4 batteries, so 10% of the charge current is 16A. The unit came
#                  configured with this set to 15, so we're leaving it there. Set this to '0' to disable 
#                  current based exiting of accept mode (and use time-based). Set to '-1' to disable current
#                  based exiting, and use time based exiting, OR exit after 5x the time spent in bulk 
#                  charging mode.

## Change OVERCHARGE parameters
## Note: I'm not sure how "over-charge mode" differs from "float" mode. See page 38 for some explanation.
# n             = [7,8] Charge Profile Table Entry that will be modified
# Limit Amps    = [-5..50 - whole] When in overcharge mode, amps from the alternator will be limited to this
#                 number. Setting this to 0 disables this. Negative values are not explained in the 
#                 documentation.
# Exit Duration = [0..600 - whole number] THis is the number of minutes after which the regulator will switch
#                 to float mode. Setting to '0' disables overcharge mode entirely. 
# Exit VBat     = [0.0..20.0 - float] This is the voltage at which the regulator will exit overcharge mode.
#                 Setting this to '0' (by the docs, '0.0' as configured?) disables overcharge mode.
# Exit Amps     = [0..50 - whole] This is the amperage where, when the current draw drops to or below this
#                 value, the regulator will exit overcharge mode. During this time, the voltage will be held
#                 at ExitVBat voltage. '0' disables this.

## Change FLOAT parameters
# n                = [7,8] Charge Profile Table Entry that will be modified
# VBat Set Point   = [0.0..16.5 - float] This sets the voltage the regulator will hold during the float
#                    phase. Setting this to 0.0 will disable all charging during float.
#                    NOTE: Was set to 13.36 (3.34v/cell). May want to change later.
# Limit Amps       = [-1..50 - whole number] This sets the amerage limit while in float mode to the set amps.
#                    If set to -1, this is disabled and only VBatSetPoint will be regulated. 
# Exit Duration    = [0..30000 - float] This is the number of minutes after which the regulator will enter
#                    post-float mode. Setting this to 0 will disable this timer and float will exit based on
