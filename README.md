# Wakespeed-WS500-Notes
This is a simple repository for notes I am taking, in the format of a Wakespeed WS500 config script

NOTE: I am NOT making claims that ANYTHING in this repository is correct. 

DO NOT load this config! 

This is meant to be a reference with notes in-line with the WS500 config. It's entirely possible I've got things wrong, and in fact, that's why I am making this public. If you see anything incorrect, comments or even a PR with corrections are welcome.
